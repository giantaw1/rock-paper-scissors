The Odin Project  Foundations project - Make a Rock-Scissors-Paper game

// Plan //

Write logic to get computer choice

write logic to get player choice

declare the player/computer score variables

write the logic to play a single round

write the logic to play a full 5-round game

// notes //

is there a more elegant way to enumerate all 9 win/tie conditions?

am i using the best/only way of generating a random choice for the computer?

// additions & improvements //

html and styling to show game on the page, rather than the console.

better messages? - results tracker, total rounds tracker   

spelling protection

click button for player choice, rather than typing

add way to repeat rounds on tie - first to 5 points

// >>> RPS-UI UPDATE <<< //

branch created 8/23 - add ui elements to rps game.

button for R/P/S player choice - run playRound when button selected

>>> display choice, running score, current round (DOM methods instead of console msgs)

>>> announce winner after 5 points scored rather than 5 rounds total

choice div and results div are hidden on launch >>> change display then add .card class for styling

// >>> TO DO <<< //

FINAL STYLING - add footer, colors, icons?, layout

WINNER MESSAGE AND RESET/PLAY AGAIN, link to github
